    Admin only.

    DELETE is a SOFT DELETE:
    Instead of removing the row, is_active=False.

    FIX (ticket: "Discount Delete — Convert to Soft Delete, same as
    Category/Product"):
      1. DELETE already stopped hard-deleting the row and already set
         is_active=False here — that part was correct. Response shape
         is untouched (still the default 204 No Content), as requested.
      2. GET /discounts/ (admin list) already returns ALL coupons
         (active + inactive) via get_queryset() below — no change
         needed, confirmed.
      3. Checkout coupon validation already rejects inactive/soft-deleted
         coupons — see DiscountValidateSerializer.validate() in
         discount_serializers.py, which filters is_active=True. Confirmed,
         no change needed.
      4. RESTORE already works via the existing PUT /discounts/{id}/
         endpoint: 'is_active' is writable on DiscountSerializer (not in
         read_only_fields), so sending {"is_active": true} on update
         reactivates a coupon. No new endpoint added, as requested.

      The one actual bug fixed here: perform_destroy() was calling
      instance.save(update_fields=["is_active"]). Because
      Discount.updated_at uses auto_now=True, Django only writes columns
      listed in update_fields — so updated_at was silently NOT being
      persisted to the database on soft-delete, breaking the "last
      modified" audit trail. Fixed by including "updated_at" in
      update_fields below.

        FIX: update_fields now includes "updated_at" as well as
        "is_active" — previously only "is_active" was listed, which
        meant the auto_now updated_at timestamp was computed in memory
        but never written to the database on delete/restore.
